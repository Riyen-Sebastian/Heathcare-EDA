    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This report provides a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the given dataset. The primary objectives of this EDA are to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the underlying structure of the data.\n",
    "- Identify patterns, anomalies, and relationships within the dataset.\n",
    "- Prepare the data for further modeling by cleaning and transforming it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover various aspects of the EDA process, including data loading, data cleaning, univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis, and Principal Component \n",
    "Analysis (PCA).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Feature\n",
    "In the duration  of our project, our primary goal has been making the processes \n",
    "MODULAR, and FUNCTIONALISED, focusing on catering to the entire dataset at any given step. We aim to standardise the process through this technique\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Loading\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will load the dataset and perform an initial examination to understand its structure and basic characteristics."
