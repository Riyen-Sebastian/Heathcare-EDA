# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Healthcare Dataset

Welcome to the repository for our Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on a healthcare dataset. This document will guide you through the structure and purpose of each folder in the repository.
In this project, we perform a thorough exploratory data analysis on a healthcare dataset to uncover patterns, identify anomalies, and extract meaningful insights 

## Project Structure

This repository is organized into several folders, each representing a key step in our EDA process:

- **Data_loading**: Scripts for loading the dataset.
- **Data Studying**: Data preparation and preprocessing steps.
- **Null_handling**: Methods for addressing missing values.
- **Outlier_handling**: Techniques for detecting and managing outliers.
- **EDA**: Scripts for detailed exploratory data analysis.
- **Reports**: Comprehensive reports and documentation of the analysis.

### **Note:** 
Each folder may have multiple scripts. Many of which , highlight key parts of the process covered in that folder
Kindly read the **About Folder** files to identify the main script in the folder

## Project Crew:
This project is the fruit of collaborative effort. Each member played a key role to shape the project into what it is.
